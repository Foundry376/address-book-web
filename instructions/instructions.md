# Introduction

This project is an empty `create-react-app` React app. You're welcome to use this template or start your own React / React Native project for this programming challenge. The goal of the template is just to help you skip the boilerplate of setting up a React project.

The goal of this open-ended programming challenge is to create a UI like the one in the screenshot below (of Apple's Contacts.app), where the user sees a list of contacts on the left and a detailed view of the selected contact on the right. Address books usually provide features like search, the ability to edit contacts, and the ability to delete contacts - more than can easily be built in a few hours! That said, if you have time, we'd love for you to explore what this small address book could do using the REST API.

# Libraries

You're welcome to use any React component libraries or other tooling you're familiar with.

# API

This project should use the demo contacts API. The API is RESTful and requires no authentication - the documentation of the available endpoints for listing, updating and deleting contacts is available here:
